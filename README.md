# Tetris Kata in Elm

This kata is playable here : https://ygrenzinger.github.io/tetris-kata-elm/

I have mainly followed the official Tetris guideline visible here : https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline

The left and right wall kicks are implemented but not the full rules of the Super Rotation System visible here : https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/SRS

Implementing a full tetris is harder than you think :)

I have also tried to mix some Property Based Testing.

**Any feedback on this Elm implementation is welcome**
